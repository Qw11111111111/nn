A small personal Project, aiming to create a modular system for neural net creation, testing and training. Strongly inspired by PyTorch.
Main objective: understand concepts of ML more deeply and try to do so only with input from mathematics textbooks.

To do: Test backprop for various cases; add more models; add more layers; add more loss functions; add more optims; optimize optims
Not tested yet.
